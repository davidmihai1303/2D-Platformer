# Sound Fugue

![Gameplay GIF placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=Gameplay+GIF+Coming+Soon)

`Sound Fugue` is a 2D platformer built for high-speed, fluid movement, heavily inspired by titles like *Rayman Origins*. The entire world is built from music.

The name is an intentional pun:
* **Sound:** The core theme of the game.
* **Fugue (Music):** A composition where different themes weave together (like the game's genre-worlds).
* **Fugue (Action):** From the Latin `fuga`, meaning "chase" or "flight" - describing the core gameplay loop.

## The Core Idea

 **Lord Tacet**, a joyless tyrant, has taken over and is trying to silence all the music. The player controls **Aeris**, an aspiring musician, our hero who must bring the music back.

The mission is to travel to the "Genre Worlds" - lands that are now silent versions of Jazz, Rock, Disco etc. - and fight the "Hushers" (the Mogul's sound-absorbing minions). By defeating each world's boss, Aeris captures its core "Essence" to restore that genre's power to the world.

## Features

* **Flow-State Movement:** The #1 priority is tight, fast, and fluid controls. The goal is to allow players to link wall-runs, air-dashes, and jumps into one seamless "flow."
* **Genre-Hopping Worlds:** Each world is a music genre gone silent, from a Rock-themed "Distortion Forge" to an industrial "Funky Factory" for the Dance world.
* **Genre-Based Abilities:** Beating a world's boss unlocks a new traversal move used to access new areas.
* **Rhythmic Levels (The Goal):** A planned feature is the addition of special levels, similar to "Castle Rock" from *Rayman Legends*, where all actions and level events sync perfectly to the music.

## Tech & Status

This is a passion project built as a deep-dive into C++ and SFML 3. It is **currently in active development.**

The current development focus is on perfecting Aeris' core physics and movement.
